# Analyzing Air Pollution and Population Density
This repository supports an ETL pipeline for merging two datasets:
- SILAM Air Quality Dataset provided by: Finnish Meteorological Institute
- High Resolution Population Density Maps + Demographic Estimates by CIESIN and Meta

and functionality for conducting analysis to answer questions such as:
- How many people are estimated to be affected by an unhealthy level of pollution, for any given pollutant?
- Where are the sources of pollution? Do they correlate generally with population density?
- For a given set of countries, how does pollution correlate with population density? Do high-pollution areas tend to exist outside of population centers?
